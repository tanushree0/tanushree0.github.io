                        <p> I am a user researcher and facilitator. I work at the
                            intersections of

                        <p>
                            I have worked in the tech industry for over eight years. I bring a significant breadth
                            in
                            experience — from user research to web development to expressive
                            arts facilitation.

                            with
                            ease, build strong collaborative relationships with designers and engineers, and to hold
                            space for
                            users and stakeholders
