                    <p>Hypertension is a long-term condition that needs patients to return for regular check-up. Getting
                        patients to return to care is a key area of focus for national hypertension
                        control programs in India and Bangladesh. One
                        way that this is achieved is through making reminder calls to patients.</p>
                    <p>The team at Obvious, Resolve to Save Lives and National Heart Foundation Bangladesh was working
                        with the goal to optimize this process — how can calling patients be made more effective and
                        successful? To kick things off, we started
                        with foundational research to understand the current process of calling patients.</p>
                    <p>
                        This study was the first in a series. My role was of a user researcher who led the study. Here,
                        I’ll take you through the process and the outcomes:
                    </p>
                    <h4>Plan</h4>
                    <h5>Objectives</h5>
                    <p>Step one, as in all studies, is to define the objectives. This works well when they are set as a
                        team.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Our objectives were to:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Understand the staff’s process of calling patients.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Learn about their experience and the pain points.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Learn about the patients’ responses.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        For each of these objectives, we also identified the research sub-questions.
                    </p>
                    <h5>Participants</h5>
                    <p>The participants for the study were staff members at the National Heart Foundation Bangladesh who
                        call patients as part of their job. The study was conducted with 5 participants.
                    </p>
                    <p>National Heart Foundation was also a partner and stakeholder in this project.
                    </p>

                    </figure>
                    <h5>Methods </h5>
                    <p>
                        We chose the methods of a diary study along with in-depth interviews. These would help us get
                        deeper and more accurate insights for our objectives. Note that in-person studies were not
                        possible due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        While designing the study, it was important to keep in mind the participants’ comfort level with
                        digital tools and with English. I chose Google Docs as our tool for creating the diary —
                        participants were familiar with it and onboarding was not required.
                        The instructions were worded in simple and friendly English.
                    </p>
                    <h5>Writing the plan</h5>
                    <p>The project plan included the timeline, objectives, interview guide and supporting resources.
                        Apart from being the go-to reference for the study, it also acted as a place where team members
                        collaborate and align on the details of the study.
                    </p>
                    <h4>Conduct</h4>
                    <h5>Diary study</h5>
                    <p>The study started with a video call to brief the participants. The participants learned about the
                        purpose of the study, and tested that they could work with their online diaries. For the diary
                        study, they were asked to log details of the phone calls they made to patients, every day, for
                        a week.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In the initial briefing call, it was important to build rapport and ensure that all
                        participants felt motivated for the week-long task at hand.
                    </p>
                    <p>As the diary study started, I reviewed their inputs and corresponded asychronously over
                        email. We had a mid-week video call for a
                        check-in. The study proceeded smoothly.
                    </p>
                    <h5>In-depth remote interviews </h5>
                    <p>At the end of the week, I conducted interviews. This was the time to learn deeply about
                        the participants' experiences. </p>
                    <p>The interviews had three main sections:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Understand their end-to-end process of calling</li>
                        <li>Clarify and probe deeper into the responses in the diaries </li>
                        <li>Generate ideas for improvement with the participants </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>As I interviewed them about their process, I shared my screen with the participant and took notes
                        on an empty journey map. This helped the participants feel more heard and engaged.
                        I find it fascinating how remote
                        interviews present unique affordances that help enhance the rapport and connection between the
                        interviewer and interviewee.

                    </figure>
                    <h4>Synthesize </h5>
                        <p>For synthesis, notes from the diary study and the interviews were reviewed and tagged.
                            They were then moved to digital post-its on Figma, and organised into groups. Post-its with
                            similar points were further clustered together.
                            Through this process of affinity diagramming, key patterns in the findings emerged.
                        </p>
                        <p>We learned how the staff members make calls to patients — at what time of the day, from which
                            locations and environments, and about the tools they use for it. We learned how their
                            message
                            is worded and
                            communicated. We
                            learned about the behaviours and responses of patients in rural Sylhet,
                            Bangladesh. Most of all, we learned in depth about the various challenges faced in this
                            process.
                        </p>
                        The participants' inputs helped us imagine and define what an "easy" call would look like.
                        <p>

                        <h4>Outcomes</h4>
                        <p>This study helped create a clear, shared understanding in the team of the process of making
                            reminder calls to patients. It gave the team insight, motivation and direction for making
                            improvements and implementing new ideas.
                        </p>
                        <p>We added features and made improvements to the Simple app and web dashboard to enhance the
                            experience of calling patients. This would help the staff reduce manual work and make more
                            informed
                            calls.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Based on the findings, we created a Standard Operating Procedure — a set of
                            best practices for making
                            effective and successful reminder calls to patients. The team would continue to iterate on
                            it based on feedback from users and stakeholders.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Participating in the interviews was energising for the staff. It helped them identify the
                            gaps in their own processes and put improvements in place on the field.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Making reminder calls to patients is a
                            key intervention used to improve large-scale hypertension control numbers by national
                            health programs in India and Bangladesh. This foundational study helped initiate long-term
                            improvements for this work for our team.
