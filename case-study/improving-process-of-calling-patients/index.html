                    <p>Hypertension is a long-term condition that needs patients to return for regular check-up. Getting
                        patients to return to care is a key area of focus for national hypertension
                        control programs in India and Bangladesh. One
                        way that this is achieved is through making reminder calls to patients.</p>

                    <p>
                        Our team at Obvious, Resolve to Save Lives and National Heart Foundation of Bangladesh was
                        working
                        for the goal of optimizing the process of calling patients — that is, how can calling patients
                        be made more effective and
                        successful?
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        To kick things off, we started with foundational research to understand the current process of
                        calling patients and the challenges faced. Here,
                        I’ll take you through the research process and the outcome:
                    </p>

                    <h2>Creating the plan</h2>
                    <h3>Defining objectives</h3>
                    <p>Step one, as in all studies, is to define the objectives. This works well when they are set as a
                        team.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Our objectives were to:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Understand the staff’s process of calling patients.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Learn about their experience and the pain points.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Learn about the patients’ responses.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        For each of these objectives, we defined the research sub-questions.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Reruiting participants</h3>
                    <p>The participants for the study were staff members at the National Heart Foundation of Bangladesh
                        who
                        call patients as part of their job. The study was conducted with 5 participants.
                    </p>
                    <p>Note: National Heart Foundation of Bangladesh was also a partner and stakeholder in this project.
                    </p>

                             alt="">
                        <figcaption></figcaption>
                    </figure>
                    <h3>Choosing methods</h3>
                    <p>
                        We chose the methods of a diary study along with in-depth interviews. These would help us get
                        deeper and more accurate insights for our objectives. Note that in-person studies were not
                        possible due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        While designing the study, it was important to keep in mind the participants’ comfort level with
                        digital tools and with English. I chose Google Docs as our tool for creating the diary —
                        participants were familiar with it and onboarding was not required.
                        The instructions were worded in simple and friendly English.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Writing the plan</h3>
                    <p>The project plan we wrote included the timeline, objectives, interview guide and supporting
                        resources.
                        Apart from being the go-to reference for the study, it also acted as a place where team members
                        collaborate and align on the details of the study.
                    </p>
                    <h2>Conducting the study</h2>
                    <p>The study consisted of a week-long diary study and subsequent in-depth remote interviews.</p>
                    <h3>1. Diary study</h3>
                    <p>The diary study started with a video call to brief the participants. The participants learned
                        about the
                        purpose of the study, and tested that they could work with their online diaries. They were asked
                        to log details of the phone calls they made to patients, every day, for
                        a week.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In the initial briefing call, it was important to build rapport and ensure that all
                        participants felt motivated for the week-long task at hand.
                    </p>
                    <p>As the diary study started, I reviewed their inputs and corresponded asychronously over
                        email. We had a mid-week video call for a
                        check-in. The study proceeded smoothly.
                    </p>
                    <h3>2. In-depth remote interviews </h3>
                    <p>At the end of the week, I conducted interviews. This was the time to learn deeply and in detail
                        about
                        the participants' process. </p>
                    <p>The interviews had three main sections:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Understand their end-to-end process of calling.</li>
                        <li>Clarify and probe deeper into the responses in the diaries. </li>
                        <li>Generate ideas for improvement with the participants. </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        Again, it was important to create a comfortable and engaging environment for the participants —
                        so that what we learned was accurate and meaningful for the project.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        There are many limitations of conducting remote interviews. The format, however, presents its
                        own afforances that improve the quality of the interviews. For instance, taking notes on an
                        experience map template while interviewing the participants, helped participants feel more
                        engaged and heard.
                    </p>

                    </figure>
                    <h2>Synthesis</h2>
                    <p>
                        To synthesise, we went over the filled-in and further annotated diaries, and notes and artifacts
                        from the interviews. We coded them with key themes. We then did a second pass and moved the
                        important notes onto digital post-its on Figma. Following the process of affinity diagramming,
                        they were clustured into groups with
                        similar themes and ideas. From here, we derived the key insights of the study.
                    </p>
                    <h3>What we learned</h3>
                    <p>We learned of the details of how staff members make calls to patients. These details included
                        when the calls are made, from which locations and environments, the series of steps followed and
                        the tools used in the end-to-end process.</p>
                    <p> We got insight into how the calls are worded, the average duration of each call, and how
                        patients in
                        rural Sylhet, Bangladesh respond on the phone calls.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Learning about the challenges faced led to us identifying design opportunities. <span
                              class="highlight">In addition,
                            participants' inputs helped us imagine and concretely define what an "easy" call would be
                            like
                            —
                            what would good user experience of calling patients be?</span>
                    </p>

                    <h2>Outcome</h2>
                    <p><span class="highlight">This study helped create a clear, shared understanding in the team
                            of the process of making
                            reminder calls to patients.</span> It gave the team insight, motivation and direction for
                        improving the process.
                    </p>
                    <p><span class="highlight">We added features to the Simple app and web
                            dashboard to enhance the
                            experience of calling patients.</span> These features would 1) reduce the manual work
                        involved in the
                        process and 2) support the caller in making
                        more
                        informed
                        calls.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span class="highlight">Based on the findings and using the existing knowledge in the team, we
                            created

                            interviewed.</span> It helped them
                        identify the
                        gaps in their own processes and put improvements in place on the field.

                    <p>
                        Making reminder calls to patients is a
                        key intervention used by national
                        health programs in India and Bangladesh to improve large-scale hypertension control numbers.
                        This foundational study helped initiate long-term
                        improvements for this work for our team.
