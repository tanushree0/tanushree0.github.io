                            This test was part of a 5-day design sprint at Obvious with the clients Resolve to Save
                            Lives and
                            George Institute for Global Health.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Our team designed an intervention to communicate messages to rural households on
                            reducing salt in
                            home-cooked food. Reducing salt intake is beneficial for controlling blood pressure and
                            reducing the risk of cardio-vascular diseases.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            These messages were focused on building awareness and providing actionable strategies, and
                            were in the form of posters and short videos. They would be delivered by an ASHA worker
                            (i.e. a community health worker) of
                            the area to
                            people at their homes.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The goal was to test the delivery of the intervention and provide clear direction to the
                            team on the designed strategy.

                        <h2>Planning the test</h2>
                        <p>
                            During the sprint, we deliberated upon who the target for the intervention
                            should be. Should it the women in
                            families who primarily cook the food? Should it be their husbands who are usually the key
                            decision makers? Should it be elder members who hold influence in the family? Or should it
                            be the
                            influencers in the village who the community would listen to?
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            After further discussion, we defined our target audience to be young couples between the
                            ages of 25–40, of medium to
                            higher income group, who were residents of two different villages and from a mix of nuclear
                            and joint families.
                        </p>

                            <figcaption>The message consisted of three posters and two videos. This is the poster on

                        </figure>

                        <p>
                            The intervention consisted of an ASHA worker delivering the health message to the couples at
                            their homes. We would test the concept through observation of the delivery of the message
                            and using interviews.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The primary objectives for this study were: 1) to evaluate the success of the message
                            delivery,
                            2) to understand the reasons people would be open to reducing use of salt, and 3) to
                            identify if the strategy of gradual salt reduction was perceived as actionable.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            One part of the team worked hard to create the prototypes in time, and the other prepared
                            to test them and traveled to the location. Per our usual practice, we conducted a pilot test
                            within the team before taking it to the field.

                        <h2>Conducting the test</h2>
                        <p>
                            We visited the homes of 6 couples in a district in Telangana. For each visit, I was
                            accompanied by one member from the stakeholder's team who observed and participated as
                            a translator.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The interview started with explaining the purpose, obtaining consent, and building rapport.
                            The initial interview questions were picked to build rapport as well as to lead into a
                            discussion on
                            their cooking practices and preferences.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The ASHA worker, who was a part of our team, shared the message with each couple. The
                            message was delivered, per a pre-decided script, using the designed artifacts of videos and
                            posters.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            We observed as the couple received the message and interacted with the ASHA worker. We then
                            interviewed them to evaluate as well as to learn. We evaluated the efficacy of the
                            components of the messsages delivered. We learned deeply about their current attitudes
                            and behaviours related to
                            salt consumption.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The next day, we visited the participants and conducted very short interviews. We learned
                            which messsages had stuck with them after one day, and if they had cooked differently the
                            previous night.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Again, it was important to build rapport and ask questions in the right way, to ensure that
                            we get authentic and accurate responses.

                        <h2>Synthesis</h2>
                        <p>
                            The field study team made detailed notes from the recordings of the interviews.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The message delivery we were evaluating had five different components. For each
                            component, we collated findings from each interview. Patterns emerged in the findings.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            For the part of the interview that was generative, we coded the interviews to clarify the
                            themes and conducted affinity mapping to synthesise.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            These findings were then presented to the entire team of stakeholders. The team learned
                            about the behaviours and attitudes of their target audience for the project. They understood
                            which components of the message worked well and why, and which components didn't work and
                            why.
                        </p>

                    <section>
                        <h2>Outcome</h2>
                        <p>
                            The test provided a clear direction to the team for moving forward.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Four in five of the messages designed to raise awareness and suggest strategies worked well.
                            They only needed further refinement. One message was not understood correctly and did not
                            align with the participants' current cooking practices. Particular messages had higher
                            recall than others.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The medium of short videos and posters, created in the local language, with locally based
                            characters and references, worked well. The intervention of the ASHA worker delivering the
                            message to
                            couples also worked well. The residents of the villages trusted the ASHA worker of their
                            area and were open to receiving the awareness message from her.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            We learned about the participant's current cooking practices, perspectives about use of salt
                            in food, and attitudes and barriers towards making changes in how much salt they consume.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The stakeholders were active participants through the sprint process. Having gained these
                            insights from the tests, they were
                            now confident in moving forward with the designed intervention. They zeroed in
                            on the messages to be developed for their large-scale salt reducation program, and decided
                            next steps
                            for further research.
