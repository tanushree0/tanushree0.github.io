                    <h2>The challenge</h2>
                    <p>
                        <a href="https://www.simple.org/">Simple</a> is an app that is designed to help clinicians
                        manage hypertensive patients. It is
                        deployed in 1033 public health facilities in India and Bangladesh, and is used to manage over
                        350,000 patients. It is supported by Resolve to Save Lives, and built by a team with people from
                        Resolve to Save Lives, Obvious and Nilenso, and public health experts from various
                        organisations.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The challenge for the project was to design a product that is easy to learn and use, even for
                        first-time smartphone users. It needed to fit into the existing, extremely busy workflows in
                        public health facilities.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        As the users’ contexts are very different from ours, it was important to build a strong user
                        research practice to set up the project for success. I worked on the project as part of the
                        design team at <a href="https://obvious.in/">Obvious</a>, as the primary user researcher. Here I
                        describe our team’s key user
                        research processes:

                        <h2>Continuous user studies
                        </h2>
                        <p>
                            We conducted continuous user studies — on the field, in our office, and remotely. The
                            studies were both generative and evaluative. Our methods included contextual inquiry,
                            interviews, concept testing, usability testing, phone surveys, co-creation and diary
                            studies.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Over two years, we interviewed above 250 clinicians and stakeholders. Iterative user
                            research meant that we stayed in tune with the product team’s process and provided
                            continuous strategic insight. The continuous feedback loop with users shaped the product
                            from its beta stages to as it scaled up.

                        <h2>Designing with users
                        </h2>
                        <p>
                            Many users we were designing for were first-time smartphone users. They included nurses,
                            doctors, pharmacists and counselors working in rural and remote parts of the country.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            For the app to be adopted, it needed to align with the mental models and contexts of the
                            users. To this end, we included co-creation and participatory design activities in
                            user studies. This helped us understand users’ ways of thinking and their needs.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            While working with health workers, we listened deeply and created safe spaces for them to
                            speak. We were sensitive to the local and cultural norms. While gathering feedback, we used
                            play-based activities. These approaches helped users share their perspectives authentically
                            and engage in participatory design processes.

                        <p>
                            Our users' contexts were very different from our team’s. So it was important to bring the
                            knowledge of users’ context to the team in a way that they could understand and act upon it.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            For each field study, 1–2 members of the engineering team joined us (before COVID-19, of
                            course!). We coached them on user research ethics, how to observe, and created small
                            research activities for them so they could engage actively on the field.
                        </p>

                                regular basis we conducted team bodystorming sessions</a>. In these, we recreated a busy
                            public health facility and team members role-played as nurses, doctors, and patients. Apart
                            from being enjoyable, these were useful in gaining a deep understanding of users’ contexts.

                        <p>
                            For any research project, we ensured that the team was well-informed at each stage —
                            planning, execution, and synthesis.

                            As the design team we identified the key metrics that aligned with the product goals.
                            Working closely with the engineering team, we set up Mixpanel dashboards to track these
                            metrics. This helped with answering key questions on product efficiency and adoption.

                            regular pulse check of users’ sentiment and how the product was faring on the field.
                            Collating results of these surveys every six months provided the team with clear direction.
