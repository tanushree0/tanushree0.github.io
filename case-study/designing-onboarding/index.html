                            Developed design for onboarding that was used by over 1000 users.
                        </p>
                    </div>

                </div>
                <div class="text-container">
                    <p> The deployment of the app was expanding to more districts and states in public health clinics in
                        India. It was key that users be able to quickly onboard to the app.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Can a healthcare worker, on installing the app, start to use it confidently
                        within 15 minutes? This was the goal of the project and what we needed to test for.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        My role in this project was that of a user researcher. I also built
                        the prototypes we tested with, with Framer.
                    </p>

                    <h2>Plan the test</h2>
                    <p>
                        The prototype would be tested with ~6 participants in each study. The participants were nurses
                        who work in
                        hospitals
                        in
                        Bangalore and measure BP of patients in their daily work. All of them owned smartphones.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The interviews were designed to create rapport and for flow. This was achieved through the
                        structuring of the interview, use of role-play and
                        props, and facilitation.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We tested two designs in two studies. In the first design, the first-time
                        user goes through a tour of the app. In the second design, the user learns the app through
                        a training video.
                    </p>
                    <h2>Conduct the test</h2>
                    <figure>
                        <img src="../../images/case-study-designing-onboarding/usability-study-office.jpg"
                             alt="User study at the Obvious office. Activities included the use of BP monitor and prescription slip.">
                        <figcaption>Use of props like BP monitor and
                            prescription slip for the user study</figcaption>
                    </figure>
                    <p>
                        The tests were conducted at the Obvious office in Bangalore. My colleague and I played the roles
                        of the note-taker and interviewer. We live-streamed the interviews for our colleagues using a
                        video
                        conferencing tool.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The initial part of the interview set the context. The participant shared details of their daily
                        work, workflow and use of technology.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We created a make-believe scenario in which the participant was asked by their hospital
                        administrator to
                        start
                        using the app for work. We observed them as they went through the onboarding
                        flow and thought aloud.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Their knowledge of the app was tested through questions and realistic tasks.
                    </p>
                    <p>Users refrained from clicking on the button called "Take a tour" — the phrase was unfamiliar and
                        was not inviting. A short training video with
                        content that was relateable worked very well.</p>
                    <h2>Analysis</h2>
                    <p>For each feature we were testing for, we listed observations and issues for each
                        participant. From this, we drew patterns on what was working well in the designs and what
                        wasn't.</p>
                    <p>
                        We prioritised issues based on severity and frequency. From here, we identified
                        potential fixes and design recommendations.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Once the report was created, the team met. We briefed them on the user test — participant
                        behaviours, key findings and design recommendations. The team then identified next steps for
                        design and research.
                    </p>
                    <h2>Outcome</h2>
                    <figure class="left-offset final-design-screenshot">
                        <img src="../../images/case-study-designing-onboarding/Watch-video-screen.jpg">
                    </figure>
                    <p>
                        Information consumption through videos worked well for all the participants. In the final
                        design, we reduced the
                        length of the video to be about 5 minutes.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We did not go ahead with the ideas of a tutorial based on 'tour' and coachmarks. These
                        paradigms were not familiar for the user base and would not scale well.
                    </p>
                    <p> We learned
                        that digital literacy varies in this section of users. Some participants were
                        technically
                        savvy and were active users of their apps. Other participants
                        did not have a basic vocabulary for use of apps — for example, they do not understand how search
                        works or how buttons work.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Later, through various channels such as field studies, phone surveys and stakeholder
                        interactions, we learned that the training video was impactful for introducing new users to
                        the app.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        At the same time, it became increasingly clear that the project would need to invest in creating
                        a
                        scaleable solution for onboarding and training. Many users are beginner users of smartphones and
                        will need hands-on training.

                    <h6>1. Align copy with users' mental model.</h6>
                    <p>
                        For example, the CTA text
                        of "Take a tour", although is found commonly in consumer apps, did not work for our
                        target users.
                    </p>
                    <blockquote>
                        "When it says, 'Take a tour', I don't understand where it will go." — Participant
                    </blockquote>
                    <p>
                        Another example is where we replaced the button text, "Got it!" to "Okay". Users did not
                        understand what "Got it" meant.
                    </p>
                    <h6>2. Short videos work well for content dissemination.</h6>
                    <p>
                        Consuming videos through apps like Youtube, JioTV and Whatsapp is common among new users of
                        smartphones who we interacted with. We consistently observed that users were comfortable with
                        watching videos on their phones.
                    </p>
                    <h6>3. If it makes sense for your context, invest in training.</h6>
                    <p>
                        For many users among the Next Billion Users, working with apps is unfamiliar and challenging.
                        They do not have an understanding of basic design patterns such as Search, Save, Set
                        password, Settings, etc.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Investing in training resources and hand-on teaching can be essential in some scenarios for your
                        product to grow.
