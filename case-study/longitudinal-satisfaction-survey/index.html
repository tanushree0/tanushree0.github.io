                    <p><a href="http://simple.org/">Simple</a> is an app for hospitals to manage their patients with
                        hypertension. The Simple software is built by a team in Bangalore, Delhi, and New York. Since
                        deploying in October 2018, the app is being
                        used by healthcare workers in over 400 public health facilities in the states of Punjab and
                        Maharashtra, India as part of the India Hypertension Control Initiative. Many of the public
                        hospitals where Simple is used are in remote
                        towns and villages.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        As the product team, we care deeply about how the app is faring on the field:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>What are the most pressing issues faced by the users?</li>
                        <li>Is it making their work easier and better?</li>
                        <li>Are there important user needs that we haven’t thought of?</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        Without regular interactions with the people who use our software, we can’t know the answers to
                        these questions.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        It might sound basic, but regularly scheduled phone calls bring us closer to our users and help
                        us identify patterns of concerns among our users. In fact, the phone calls are one of our most
                        effective ways to keep our fingers on the pulse of Simple in
                        the field.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Here are the key aspects of our interview process that get us helpful and actionable insights:
                    </p>
                    <h4>Create a safe space, quickly</h4>
                    <p>If we want to gain authentic feedback from users, the first step is to create a safe space for
                        them. We focus on creating a safe space quickly. This leads to the conversations being very
                        effective — we learn a lot in a very short time.</p>
                    <p>Within the first one minute of the call, we establish that we intend to listen to them. We pay
                        attention to their words, tone and underlying emotions — and we ask relevant follow-up
                        questions. We ‘reflect’ what we hear to confirm our
                        understanding of the users’ experience and to help them feel heard.</p>
                    <p>This enables the users to share honest feedback with us — both positive and negative — and that
                        is really valuable.</p>
                    <figure>
                        <img src="../../images/case-study-phone-interviews/calling-healthcare-workerr.png"
                             alt="On the phone with a healthcare worker">
                        <figcaption>On the phone with a healthcare worker</figcaption>
                    </figure>

                    <h4>Keep the interviews short</h4>
                    <p>Our users are busy people with demanding jobs. A phone interview does not need to be exhaustive.
                        A short interview (we do 10–15 minute phone calls) will help you narrow down your questions to
                        the key issues. Short interviews also mean
                        faster synthesis afterwards, so your regular cadence of interviews won’t become a burden to you
                        and your product team.</p>
                    <h4>Structure the interview</h4>
                    <p>The interview is structured to ensure that it flows well, is not rushed, and that we cover all
                        the questions that we have planned for. Here is what the structure looks like:</p>
                    <h5>1. Introduction</h5>
                    <p>In this we introduce ourselves, explain the purpose of the interview, and check that they have
                        ten minutes to speak with us.</p>
                    <h5>2. Initial question about the interviewee</h5>
                    <p>We ask them about their role and their primary responsibilities at the hospital that they work
                        at.
                    </p>
                    <h5>3. Feature usage questions</h5>
                    <p>
                        We ask them about their use of three primary features of the app. We learn about how they use
                        these features, and if they are working well for them.
                    </p>
                    <h5>4. Satisfaction rating</h5>
                    <p>
                        We ask the user to rate the app between 1 and 5. We ask them to support their rating with
                        reasons. We ask them to share what they like about the app and issues that they are facing
                        related to the app.
                    </p>
                    <h5>5. Conclusion</h5>
                    <p>
                        We ask if there’s anything else related to the app that they’d like to share. We ask them to
                        share any further issues on the support group. We thank them for their time.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The key is to be listening intently to the users throughout, while ensuring that the interview
                        progresses according to the structure. Additionally, we want to keep the length of these
                        interviews to be less than 15 minutes because 1) healthcare workers
                        have busy work lives and 2) to keep our telephonic interviews process lean and inexpensive.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Here is the <a
                           href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1sDMaPtJcz-HCUKhr71OzMHfIjD7yF7OEzzKi9a3rPbU/edit">interview
                            guide</a> that we use.
                    </p>
                    <h4>Keep a regular cadence</h4>
                    <p>Me and my product team are busy. I bet yours is too! The only way we keep our interviews on the
                        rails is by scheduling them ahead of time for the whole year. Block off your calendar for a
                        couple of days on a consistent schedule, explicitly
                        for conducting and synthesising your phone interviews.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        It’s key to maintain a regular cadence — we call users every 3 weeks. We ask a consistent set of
                        questions to be able to track the progress of the performance of the app over time. Each time,
                        we select one of the districts where Simple is deployed and
                        speak with 5–6 active users of Simple from the district — this helps us find patterns.
                    </p>
                    <h4>Ask the same (or similar) questions every time</h4>
                    <p>
                        We ask a consistent set of questions every time. These help us evaluate the performance of the
                        most important features of the app over time, and also across locations as we continue to scale.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        For example, back in January 2019, the patient search feature was causing the most issues for
                        users in Punjab. Since then, the Simple team has made several improvements to patient search
                        including introducing a scannable patient ID. In interviews conducted
                        in October 2019, we received extremely positive feedback on the improvements. 5 of 5 users of
                        the district shared that they were using the new features to find patients and they no longer
                        faced issues in finding the right patients
                        in the app.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Through asking a consistent set of questions over this year, we have been able to track the
                        progress of the key features of the app.
                    </p>
                    <h4>
                        Stay in tune with the product team
                    </h4>
                    <p>
                        The focus of the phone interviews is to get feedback and findings that are both current and
                        relevant. This helps us move fast as a team.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        When we release a new feature or a big change, we include a relevant question in our next
                        interviews. Learning whether the feature is working well and how the feature is being used helps
                        us make decisions on improving the product.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        When we released the “Recent Patients” feature (a list of the recently visited patients that is
                        displayed on the home screen of the app), we spoke with users to understand how they use the
                        feature and if they use it at all. We learned that it was being
                        used in a variety of ways and some that we had not anticipated while designing the feature. This
                        understanding helps us iterate on and refine our designs.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Later, during our field visits, we observed the use of the feature and further strengthened our
                        understanding of it.
                    </p>

                    </figure>
                    <h4>Collate satisfaction rating along with the supporting ‘why’</h4>
                    <p>We ask each user to give the app a rating between 1 to 5. We ask them to support their rating
                        with reasons. This question is asked towards the end of the interview to ensure a comfortable
                        space has been established.</p>
                    <p>
                        We share these ratings with the team every time we conduct the interviews. Additionally, every
                        few months, we do a collation of these ratings. <a
                           href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1nTMH31oSfY1WsxLcXyL01kDThrYwDuyxOjG21FohpEk/edit">See
                            the consolidated ratings from June 2019.</a>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Users who gave the app a rating of 3 or 4 gave it because they were facing issues while using
                        the overdue list feature or while looking up patients. Users who gave a rating of 5 stated that
                        the app worked well work for them, and it had simplified as well
                        as enhanced the quality of their work.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        These satisfaction ratings are a metric that we want to continually improve.
                    </p>
                    <h4>Phone interviews should be part of a larger effort to learn from users</h4>
                    <p>
                        Phone interviews complement our other customer support and user research efforts. Issues
                        reported to customer support are initiated by users — in the case of phone interviews, we are
                        proactively reaching out to users. This means that sometimes we are
                        a step ahead of finding issues in the field. Secondly, it helps us reach out to people who
                        otherwise may be uncomfortable or may be too busy to post concerns proactively. When we visit
                        the field (which we do often), we can validate
                        the findings from the phone interviews.

                        Over the past year we have reached out to 50+ users across all of the 7 districts that Simple is
                        deployed in. Phone interviews have established a continual feedback loop between the product
                        team and the users of Simple. They are a foundation for our product
                        development process because they keep us in close touch with our users over time.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Through conducting these interviews we’ve learnt that if you create the right environment and
                        with a strong plan, you can learn a lot from a short 15-minute phone conversation. If you
                        maintain a regular cadence and collate the findings on a regular basis,
                        the interviews will provide excellent insight and direction for your product.
